# Introduction to Python
Repo for all materials for Introduction to Python

To include:
1. Lesson Plan
2. Learning Objectives
3. Example Datasets [Variety of different domains]
4. Intended Audience
5. GitHub Repo
6. Source on Google Slides - output in the repo is a PDF


# Lesson objectives
By the end of the session, participants will:
- Have a high level understanding of what code is
- Recognise that there are many programming languages and that Python is a good place for beginners to start
- Broadly appreciate why we are using a Jupyter notebook as an interpretor and be able to create a new notebook
- Identify core programming concepts including data types, conditions, loops and lists
- Have applied theses concepts to real, relevant data
- Have experience of manipulating data stored in seperate files so that they can conduct some basic manipulations on their own data in the future, or feel able to use tutorials and guides available online to help them do these manipulations.

# Lesson overview

# Materials required (including data)

# Participant instructions
What participants need to do before attending...

# Running Jupyter notebook locally
Follow participant's install instructions (todo). Install extensionsconfig viewer using `conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions` in Anaconda Prompt. You can then browse an enable extensions using the 'Nbextensions' tab or at localhost:8889/nbextensions.

Install RISE (for presenting slides): `conda install rise`

Currently in use: 'Exercise', RISE
