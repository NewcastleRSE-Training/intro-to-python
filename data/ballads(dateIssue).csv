Shortly before Christmas 1875 they made another attempt at a reconciliation, but no sooner had they got back together than she threatened to leave if he didn't curb his drinking. On 23rd February, he borrowed an axe from a neighbour, at his wife's request, and began to chop some logs for the fire. Whilst engaged in the chore, his wife began to curse him, and in a rage he struck her with the axe. He pleaded that he had acted in self-defence after she had attacked him with a kettle, but the testimony of his step-daughter was enough to convince the court of his guilt and he was hanged by William Marwood in Bristol on the 24th April 1876. First line of text reads: On Tuesday afternoon at Brstol, a man/ named Deacon killed his wife by cutting her/ head open with a chopper.
