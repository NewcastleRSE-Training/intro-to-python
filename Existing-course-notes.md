__[Django-carrots](https://github.com/ggcarrots/django-carrots/blob/master/source/install.rst)__  
Setup: Asks participants to download and install a Python interpretor inc. setting PATH variable. Most work is done in the comman line within a virtual environment. Option to install IPython to improve appearance. I think this assumes some confidence with the command line.
- addition and printing strings

- using variables within the same file
- calling functions inc. if, boolean, indentation. Task is to create rock, scissors, paper game.
- lists and for loop to draw xmas tree on console

__[James Hetherington](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rsd-engineeringcourse/ch00python/00pythons.html)__  
- Why python and the different ways to use (good for allowing for people to expand from Jupyter after class)(and why we would want to code at all)
- variables
- functions
- types
- mutable, tuples, containers
- dictionaries
- more complex structures 
- if, comparison, indentation
- comprehensions
- defining functions
- modules
- classes  
(more beyond beginner)

__[Python for Humanities](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-humanities-lesson/setup/)__

- Why use python and what is an interpretor
- Data types, operators, lists, loops
- importing data and using libraries (some e.gs of DH data) -> maybe good for intermediate course from here on
- manipulating data and Data Forms and pandas
- workflows and automation
- making plots
- SQL
