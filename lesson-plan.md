### Notebook 1 - Introduction 20 mins
Predominantly facilitator led. Participants can run and write their first lines of code.
* Session structure
* RSE team
* What to expect
* Introduction to programming
* Setup

### Notebook 2 - Data types 30 mins
Facilitator to deliver core concepts with some opportunities for participants to complete exercises. During delivery there are opportunities for discussion and for participants to be invited to guess before code blocks are run.
* floats/ integers
* strings
* boolean

### Notebook 3 - Comparisons, Loops and Lists 40 mins
There is still a core of facilitator delivery in this notebook, but there are more frequent opportunities for participants to complete short exercises to apply concepts as they are introduced. Again, the facilitator should make opportunities for discussion around the content.

### Notebook 4 - Introduction to working with data 60 mins (including extended exercise section)
This notebook is intended to give participants an introduction to some basic data manipulation using the pandas library. The first sections should be done as a group with each participant attempting to write the code themselves before the facilitator reveals the correct answers. Hidden code blocks contain template code for the facilitator to do this, although note that filenames will need to be added depending on the dataset chosen.

The exercises in this section are intended to be self directed with participants working through a question sheet using information in their notebooks. The facilitator should be on hand to address queries during this section.

* CSV
* Packages
* DataFrame
* First steps in pandas
* Exercises
